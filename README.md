# Go! Booster pedal

Project files for the Go! Booster.

Hopefully at some point I will remember to upload an offboard wiring mini PCB for the 3PDT switch you will need.

The 3mm LED in the opamp feedback path will add some clipping; a heavy clipping diode like a germanium diode might cause too much signal loss, so if you're going to experiment, then socket the diode.

I personally tend to leave it blank; the production Go! doesn't have anything in that spot.

Finally, obviously you can wire the treble control up to an actual pot. This PCB should just about fit in a 1590A, but I choose to put it in a roomier 125B as I prefer the form factor.

Happy hacking!
